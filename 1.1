Exercise 1.2

(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))

Exercise 1.3

(define (sumTwoLargestSquares a b c)
  (define (square x) (* x x))
  (apply +
    (map square
      (list (max a b) (max (min a b) c)))))

Exercise 1.4

If b (the second argument) is positive it is added to a.  If it is negative
it is subtracted from a.  In effect, it adds the absolute value of b to a.
It does this by returning either the + or - operator as the function to apply
to the two arguments.

Exercise 1.5

The function p is infinitely recursive.  If it is ever evaluated, the program
will go into an infinite loop and never halt.  In applicative-order evaluation,
since the operands are evaluated first and p is an operand of test, the
infinite loop will be triggered.  In normal order this will not happen because
the code will be expanded until p is an operand of the if special form. That
will evaluate its first operand, find it to be true and not progress to
evaluate the second

Exercise 1.6

Alyssa's new-if function will cause the program to recur infinitely.  This is
because (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) is passed as an operand to new-if and
in Scheme's applicative-order evaluation, will be evaluated before new-if is
applied to the result.  Scheme functions do not have the lazy evaluation
properties of the if special form.
